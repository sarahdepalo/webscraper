# Indeed Webscraper

It had been a while since I've touched Python, so this little webscraper was a fun project to get back into the language. The script simply asks what job title you are searching for and the location. Each result is stored in its own .txt file. 

This awesome [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVv6mJpFOb0) was used for the majority of the project. 

## How to Use

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/sarahdepalo/webscraper

# Change into the directory
$ cd webscraper

# Install dependencies
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the script
python3 main.py
```
